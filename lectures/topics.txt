Introduction to Chaos and Ergodicity

1. Dynamical Systems
- Definition
- Examples of different behavior, logistic family of maps

2. Chaos
- Hyperbolicity
- Shadowing. Proof for contractions

3. Ergodic Theory
- Invariant Measures
- Perron-Frobenius Operator
- Birkhoff Ergodic Thm
- Mixing. Proof Mixing Implies Ergodicity (Easy)

Time permitting
- Decay of Correlations
- Mixing = Exponential Decay of Correlations
- Proof of Exponential Decay for some simple map using PF Operator
